# In this chapter

1. you get a foundation for the rest of the book
2. You write your first search algorithm (binary search)
3. You learn how to talk about the running time of an algorithm (Big O notation)
4. You're intorudced to a common technique for designing algorithms (recursion)


## Big O of Binary Search
In general, for any sorted list of n, binary search will take log2n steps to run in the worst case, whereas simple search will take n steps.

## Logarithms
You may not remember what logarithms are, but you probably know what exponentials are. log10 100 is like asking, "How many 10s do we multiply together to get 100?" The answer is 2 (10 * 10) so log10 100 = 2.
Logs are the flip of exponentials
