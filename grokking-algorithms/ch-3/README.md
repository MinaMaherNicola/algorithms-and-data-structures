# Recursion
Most important tip: When writing a recursive function, you have to tell it when to stop recursing.

That's why every recursive function has two parts: the base case, & the recursive case.

The recursive case: is when the function calls itself.
The base case: is when the function doesn't call itself again, so it doesn't go into an infinite loop.
